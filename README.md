# DDoS-Protection-System-For-Cloud

This project is a custom-designed DDoS Protection System built to secure cloud-hosted web applications from Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. It includes intelligent detection, automated mitigation, and recovery tools to maintain high availability and minimal downtime ‚Äî even during active attacks.

The system simulates real-world attack scenarios using a testbed with EC2 instances, enabling realistic evaluation of defense mechanisms. Inspired by services like AWS Shield, this project demonstrates how to build a flexible and robust protection framework without relying on third-party tools.

üîê Key Features

- Real-Time Traffic Monitoring using TShark and Scapy
- Anomaly Detection based on packet rates, IP behavior, and flooding patterns
- Top Attacker IP Reporting for visibility and analysis
- Mitigation Engine that blocks or rate-limits malicious IPs
- Auto-Recovery Tools to restore normal traffic after an attack subsides
- Traffic Simulation using controlled EC2-based flooding to test resilience
- Modular Design for easy integration with custom cloud setups


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python (for detection and mitigation scripts)
- TShark & Scapy (for packet capture and analysis)
- Apache2 / EC2 Instances (for hosting and attack simulation)
- Bash Scripts (for automation and control)


üìä Architecture Overview

1. Traffic Capture ‚Üí Real-time monitoring of incoming packets
2. Detection Engine ‚Üí Identifies abnormal traffic patterns
3. IP Blacklist Generator ‚Üí Dynamically blocks attackers
4. Mitigation Pipeline ‚Üí Routes or drops suspicious traffic
5. Recovery & Reporting ‚Üí Logs attack details and restores normal operation
