# DDoS-Protection-System-For-Cloud

This project is a custom-designed DDoS Protection System built to secure cloud-hosted web applications from Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. It includes intelligent detection, automated mitigation, and recovery tools to maintain high availability and minimal downtime â€” even during active attacks.

The system simulates real-world attack scenarios using a testbed with EC2 instances, enabling realistic evaluation of defense mechanisms. Inspired by services like AWS Shield, this project demonstrates how to build a flexible and robust protection framework without relying on third-party tools.
